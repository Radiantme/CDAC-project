# Vehicle Automation System using CAN Protocol | Embedded System Design
Sep 2023 â€“ Feb 2024 
The project utilizes an STM32G431MBT6-based INDUS microcontroller for a vehicle automation system, 
featuring CAN Bus communication via ATA6561-GAQW-N module, Real-time multitasking with RTOS, 
Sensor integration (MQ2, LM35) for engine temperature monitoring and smoke gas detection. This system 
aims to enhance safety and performance through proactive maintenance and real-time data exchange.
